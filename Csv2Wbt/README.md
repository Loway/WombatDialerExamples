Csv2Wbt
=======

One common issue when running WombatDialer is that you will likely have (or prepare)
a number list using a spreadsheet, but in order to upload it to a list you will
have to use its own format, so that if you have a CSV file like:

     NUM,NAME,ID
     5551234,Mike Boo,567
     5551235,John Dee,896

you should convert it to:

     5551234,NAME:Mike Boo,ID:567
     5551235,NAME:John Dee,ID:896

And that's what the script here does.

Usage:
------

    perl csv2wbt.pl -f SampleDialData.csv [-n NUMBER]

The option '-f' is mandatory and that's the file it should be reading. We have a 
sample data file you can use to check the expected format.

The option '-n' is optional and used to change the field used to store the number. 
The default is "NUM" but you can change it. Note that filed names are case-sensitive.

The converted file is printed to STDOUT, so you can redirect to a file if you prefer to.

In order to upload it to WombatDialer, select a list, click on "Upload list of numbers"
and paste all output generated by the script.

Notes
-----

The CSV format expected is plain - only ASCII characters, no string qualifiers.
